# velsanet-whitepapers
Structural white papers defining the architectural foundations of Velsanet. This repository contains no executable code.
## Purpose of This Repository

This repository is not a product, a proposal, or a collection of features.

It defines the structural conditions under which Velsanet exists.
The documents here do not explain what to build.
They fix what must be structurally true before implementation, optimization, or interpretation.

No executable code is provided by design.

## How to Read These White Papers

These white papers are not meant to be read sequentially as tutorials.

Each document fixes a specific structural boundary.
Together, they form a single architectural system.

If you read them as feature descriptions, they will not connect.
If you read them as structural constraints, the system will emerge naturally.
