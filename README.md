velsanet-whitepapers

Structural white papers defining the architectural foundations of Velsanet.

This repository contains architectural documents only.
No executable code is included.

Purpose of This Repository

This repository documents the structural foundations of Velsanet.

It does not present a product, a feature roadmap, or an implementation guide.
Instead, it defines the architectural constraints and system conditions that must hold before any implementation, optimization, or deployment.

The focus is structural coherence rather than functional description.

How to Read These White Papers

These documents are not tutorials.

Each white paper establishes a specific architectural boundary — spatial, mathematical, physical, cognitive, or governance-related.

Individually, they define constraints.
Collectively, they form a unified topology-first, AI-native network architecture.

They should be read as structural definitions rather than feature explanations.
