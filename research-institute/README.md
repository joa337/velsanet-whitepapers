# Velsanet Research Institute

A structural platform for the realization of topology-first, AI-native network architecture.

---

## Purpose

The Velsanet Research Institute is proposed as a physical and governance foundation for the deployment and validation of the Velsanet architecture.

It is not a think tank.
It is not an incubator.
It is a structural execution platform.

The Institute exists to:

- Validate topology-first network models
- Prototype optical-native infrastructure (MOCT)
- Deploy three-layer AI (PAI / AAI / AsAI)
- Demonstrate sovereign structural governance (Q2–Q7)
- Establish city-scale experimental environments

---

## Architectural Position

The Research Institute corresponds to the physical realization layer of the Velsanet framework.

White Papers define the structure.
The Institute implements it.

Structural domains include:

- Polyhedral role layers (T4, C6, O8, D12, I20)
- Parallel optical E2E deployment
- Identity-bound path formation
- Projection-based governance hierarchy
- Q7–Q4 operational mapping

---

## Governance Model

The Institute operates under structural principles:

- No centralized control
- Sovereignty encoded in topology
- Participation through contribution
- Expansion through structural admissibility

The Institute is aligned with:

- IMT-2030 / 6G framework discussions
- ITU-T Study Group 13 contributions
- Open academic and industrial collaboration

---

## Location

Saemangeum Special Zone, Republic of Korea  
Proposed as a large-scale experimental and deployment ground for next-generation intelligent networks.

---

## Participation

Participation is open to:

- Governments (sovereign layer construction)
- Enterprises (technology validation & deployment)
- Universities and research institutions (formal study & standardization)
- International organizations (structural coordination)

Participation is structural, not symbolic.

---

## Scope

This directory contains:

- Vision documents
- Governance framework descriptions
- Deployment concept materials
- Institutional structural models

---

Velsanet Research Institute  
A platform where topology becomes infrastructure.


## Position in the Velsanet Architecture

The Research Institute represents the execution layer of Velsanet.

White Papers define the structural theory.
The ITU contribution defines the standardization direction.
The Research Institute defines the real-world implementation environment.

Together, these three components form a complete architectural cycle.
