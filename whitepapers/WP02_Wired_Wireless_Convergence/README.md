## Structural Role

This white paper fixes the structural role of wired–wireless convergence in the Velsanet architecture.

It defines how wireless and wired domains are integrated at the structural level,
before any discussion of protocols, radio technologies, or deployment models.

This document constrains how access, aggregation, and core layers interact.
