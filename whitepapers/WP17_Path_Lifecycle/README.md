**## Structural Role

This white paper fixes the lifecycle of paths
within the Velsanet architecture.

It defines paths as entities that evolve over time,
not as static connections.

This document constrains how paths are created,
maintained, transformed, and terminated
without breaking end-to-end structural consistency.
