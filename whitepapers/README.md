## Structural Research Materials

In addition to the fixed white paper series (WPxx), this repository also contains a `research/` directory.

Materials under `research/` document ongoing structural exploration, draft papers, and reference artifacts
that are consistent with the architectural conditions defined by the white papers.

These research materials are not proposals or standards.
They serve as an open record of structural reasoning, evolution, and validation.
