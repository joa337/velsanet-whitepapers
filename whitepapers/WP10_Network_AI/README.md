Structural Role

This white paper fixes the structural role of Network AI
within the Velsanet architecture.

It defines intelligence as partially embedded in the network itself,
not only in end systems or standalone AI models.

This document constrains how network behavior,
routing, topology, and coordination participate
in intelligent system operation.
