Structural Role

This white paper fixes the structural role of multimodal composition
in the Velsanet architecture.

It defines how heterogeneous modalities are arranged,
bounded, and related within a cube-based structural model,
before any discussion of data formats or processing logic.

This document constrains how multimodal signals coexist
without collapsing into a single representation.
