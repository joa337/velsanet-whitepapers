## Structural Role

This white paper fixes the structural conditions
under which paths are formed in the Velsanet architecture.

It defines path formation as a structural process,
not as a routing or optimization problem.

This document constrains how connections emerge,
persist, and relate across nodes and layers
before any path selection or control logic.
