## Structural Role

This white paper fixes the structural identity of nodes
within the Velsanet architecture.

It defines node color as a structural identifier,
not a visual label or implementation detail.

This document constrains how roles, responsibilities,
and interactions are distinguished among nodes
without relying on hierarchy or function alone.
