# Distributed vs Centralized Optical Network
## Structural Impact on Maintenance and Cost
### A Research Note Based on Velsanet Architecture

This document is a structural research note explaining the cost and maintenance
implications of centralized versus distributed optical network architectures.

It focuses on physical structure, branching behavior, and long-term operational cost,
rather than performance metrics or protocol-level comparisons.

The analysis is based on the architectural principles of Velsanet.
