Quantum Communication Interpretation of Velsanet

Soft-Linear Governance Architecture for Scalable Quantum-Aware Networks

This document provides a structural reinterpretation of the Velsanet architecture through the lens of quantum communication.

Rather than proposing a quantum network implementation or simulating quantum mechanics within classical systems, this work examines whether Velsanet’s core structural concepts remain valid when quantum constraints are taken seriously. Concepts such as Jump, Horizontal Transition, and Projection are treated not as metaphors, but as governance mechanisms that align with how quantum states transition, decohere, and become observable under physical limits.

The central premise of this document is that once communication involves quantum states, the network can no longer be treated as a neutral transport layer. It becomes part of the physical process itself. From this perspective, Velsanet is understood as a quantum-aware governance architecture, not a quantum computer and not a performance-optimized AI network.

This document explains why:

Continuous state assumptions break down under quantum constraints

Excessive local computation (e.g., GPU-centric AI-RAN) becomes a structural source of noise

Scalability requires horizontal reconfiguration rather than vertical escalation

Governance must operate as pre-collapse constraint definition, not post-collapse control

The notion of soft linearity is introduced to describe the narrow regime in which discrete quantum jumps coexist with macroscopically stable and governable communication flows. This is not an optimization strategy, but a survivability condition under scale.

This document is published as an open research material.
It is not a proposal, standard, or implementation guide.
Meaningful discussion and critique presuppose familiarity with the underlying Velsanet architecture and its structural assumptions.
