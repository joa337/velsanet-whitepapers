# Structural Role

This white paper fixes the structural definition of the Velsanet matrix.

It defines how multi-dimensional connectivity, planes, and intersections are organized
before any discussion of routing, control, or implementation.

This document constrains all architectures that rely on parallel structure and spatial composition.
