## Structural Role

This white paper fixes the physical conditions required for parallel end-to-end connectivity in the Velsanet architecture.

Transmission is not treated as a matter of bandwidth or speed.
The Multi-Optical-Core Transceiver is defined as a structural requirement,
not an implementation choice.

This document explains why single-core transmission models cannot support parallel E2E structures
and how multi-core transmission constrains all higher-level architectures in Velsanet.
