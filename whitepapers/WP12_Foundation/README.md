## Structural Role

This white paper fixes the foundational layer of the Velsanet architecture.

It defines the non-negotiable structural assumptions
that all network, AI, governance, and operational layers depend on.

This document establishes what cannot be changed,
optimized, or interpreted without breaking the system.

All higher-level structures in Velsanet inherit their constraints from this foundation.
