## Structural Role

This white paper fixes the structural role of the City E2E Management Center
within the Velsanet architecture.

It defines how end-to-end coordination, control,
and responsibility are organized at the city scale.

This document constrains how urban systems, agents,
and infrastructures participate in a unified E2E structure
without collapsing into centralized control.
