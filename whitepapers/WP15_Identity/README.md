## Structural Role

This white paper fixes the structural definition of identity
within the Velsanet architecture.

It defines identity as a persistent structural reference,
not as credentials, profiles, or access tokens.

This document constrains how individuals, agents,
and systems are recognized, related, and maintained
across the network without central authority.
