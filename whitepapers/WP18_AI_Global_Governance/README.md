## Structural Role

This white paper fixes the global structural conditions
under which Network AI and governance coexist
within the Velsanet architecture.

It defines governance as a structural constraint,
not as a controlling authority.

This document constrains how intelligence,
sovereignty, and coordination scale globally
without centralization or fragmentation.
