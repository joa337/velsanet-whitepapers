# WP19: Velsanet Cognition Cube System

## Overview
This white paper introduces the **Velsanet Cognition Cube System**, a revolutionary AI-Native framework designed for **6G** networks. The system optimizes multi-channel communication and cognitive data processing, laying the groundwork for intelligent networks of the future.

## Key Concepts
- **AI-Native Network**: Embedding intelligence within the network architecture rather than adding it as an overlay.
- **Cognition Cube System**: A structural model that transforms real-world signals into cognitive units that can be processed for decision-making.
- **6G Integration**: The system is designed to fit seamlessly within future **6G networks**, enhancing connectivity and computational efficiency.
