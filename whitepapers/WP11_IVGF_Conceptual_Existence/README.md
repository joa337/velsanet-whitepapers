Structural Role

This white paper fixes the conceptual existence conditions
of the Velsanet architecture.

It defines the boundary between technical systems,
governance structures, and autonomous intelligence.

This document establishes IVGF as a conceptual framework,
not an organization, protocol, or policy body.

It constrains how authority, responsibility,
and structural legitimacy emerge within Velsanet.
