Structural Role

This white paper fixes the three-layer structure of AI
within the Velsanet architecture.

It defines intelligence as a layered system,
where each layer has a distinct structural role
and cannot be collapsed into a single model.

This document constrains how AI layers interact,
separate responsibilities, and maintain structural integrity.
